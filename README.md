### About The Project

##### The rules are pretty simple: 
1. You choose a level
2. Then you will be redirected to the cards layout
3. You make a guess where a bug is by clicking on a card. 
4. After a click, the card is opened. In case you find a bug - you win. 
5. If there is no bug, the game is over, and you can start from the beginning once again.
