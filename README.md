# JSCardGame

Card game built on pure Javascript. 

A player can choose between 3 levels, based on the level chosen, the number of cards will be set: 
+ simple (3 cards)
+ intermediate (6 cards)
+ advanced (10 cards)
  
The rules are pretty simple: 
1. You choose a level
2. Then you will be redirected to the cards layout
3. You make a guess where a bug is by clicking on a card. 
4. After a click, the card is opened. In case you find a bug - you win. 
5. If there is no bug, the game is over, and you can start from the beginning once again.
